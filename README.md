Card_Flip_Game and WLStats each have their own main methods that use both Deck and Card

Card_Flip_Game is a game where the game creates 5 hidden cards, one black card and 4 red cards.
You then pick one of the 5 cards as "your choice", 3 red cards are revealed to you and you are given
the option to either swap your card or keep you current choice. If you pick the black card you win.

WLStats allows for multiple playthroughs of the game to gather statistical data Win/Loss percentages

This was asked as an interview problem that was given to an old roommate that I decided to do for fun
and to demonstrate my understanding of OO programming.
